# üöÄ INTRODUCTION

The `ft_irc` project challenges students to developing an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server in C++98.
The goal is to understand how a network protocol works, manage multiple clients simultaneously, and apply concepts of system programming and sockets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Program Specificities and Considerations

In this project, we need to develop a lot of things :  
- Develop an IRC server in C++98.  
- Don't need to develop a client.  
- Don't need to manage server-to-server communication.  
- Binary should be called like this: `./ircserv <port> <password>`  
- Communication between the client and the server will be done in TCP/IP (v4 or v6).  
- However, only the following features are required:  
  - You must be able to authenticate, set a nickname and username, join a channel, and send and receive private messages with your reference client.  
  - All messages sent by a customer in a channel must be forwarded to all customers who have joined that channel.  
  - You must have basic operators and users.  
  - You must therefore implement the channel operator-specific commands:  
    - `KICK` ‚Äì Kick a client from the channel  
    - `INVITE` ‚Äì Invite a customer to the channel  
    - `TOPIC` ‚Äì Change or view the channel theme  
    - `MODE` ‚Äì Change the channel mode:  
      - `i`: Set/delete invite-only channel  
      - `t`: Set/remove TOPIC command restrictions for channel operators  
      - `k`: Set/delete channel key (password)  
      - `o`: Grant/withdraw channel operator privilege  
      - `l`: Set/remove user limit for channel  

and we need to manage `[Ctrl D](mandatory/src/Server.cpp)`, for example :
```bash
KI^DCK us^Der6
```

this command must works.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

For test my program, the simple way is to use `netcat`, so
